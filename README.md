# PilferShush Jammer

Research and project page : https://www.cityfreqs.com.au/pilfer.php

Android microphone checker and jamming application built for AOSP LineageOS.  

Application for low battery requirement microphone passive jamming.

Calls audioRecord.startRecording() but DOES NOT READ THE AUDIO BUFFER.

Holds microphone access and should block user apps from gaining focus of microphone.

System telephone calls will override and bump the Jammer from the microphone. 

Adds a notification as a reminder for running while in background.

Tested and blocks Google Voice search (user) app.

Active jammer - tone and white noise versions, boost EQ for higher amplitude.

Scan user installed apps for key features, possible NUHF/ACR SDK package name matches and services/receivers running.

Jammers run as a foreground service

Build update: compile API 28 (Pie, 9.0), Android Studio 3.4.1 stable

Note: On devices running Android 9 (API level 28) or higher, apps running in the background cannot access the microphone. 
Therefore, your app should record audio only when it's in the foreground or 
**when you include an instance of MediaRecorder in a foreground service.**

**TODO:**
- rebuild the active jammer (testing with Oboe)
- consider user app summary include and print package name of NUHF/ACR if found
- consider setCameraDisabled(ComponentName admin, boolean disabled) in menu, to run with passive
- consider optional jammer state persistence over boot


**Changes:**
- update buildtools
- redesign UI
- new icons
- prep for ver 4.0
