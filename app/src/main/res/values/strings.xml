    <string name="readme_dialog_3">Summary: lists user installed apps and checks for record audio ability, start at boot, background services, background receivers, NUHF/ACR SDK name inclusion and Accessibility service use for gaining special functions.</string>
    <string name="readme_dialog_4">Search: provides more information about a specific user installed app and any services or receivers it has. These names are usually an indication of their function but they can be non-sensical, random letters.</string>
    <string name="readme_dialog_5">SDK list: is the current names of known packages from companies that provide near ultra-high frequency listening and/or automated content recognition abilities. PilferShush app searches the user installed apps for any package names that make a match from this list. This is not a proof of any app behaviour but merely one method to provide more information to the user about the apps on their devices.</string>
    <string name="readme_dialog_6">The PASSIVE Jammer is the primary method of defence against unwanted use of the device microphone by user installed apps. It utilises a current feature of the Android API that insists that only one user app may use the microphone at a time. PilferShush asks the Android system for access to the microphone via the AudioRecord function and then asks to start recording. At this point the microphone is now ready to provide the requesting app with audio data. PilferShush does not ask for this audio data but simply maintains its hold on the microphone. Initially, on older Android devices, this was enough but with later versions it is now necessary to create and prepare a MediaRecorder function so that PilferShush is still allowed to access the microphone while running in the background. System apps such as Telephone will always override and take control of the microphone. Some voice assistants and accessibility apps, depending on their setup, may still access the microphone during this passive jamming. As of Android 10 (Q) concurrent use of the microphone is allowed which means another user app may take over the microphone while PilferShush is jamming in the background. Limited responses are possible at the moment but a pop up should appear in the middle of the screen to inform the user of an Android 10 device that another app has control of the microphone and that PilferShush is attempting to regain blocking control of the microphone. More research is being carried out.</string>
    <string name="readme_dialog_7">The ACTIVE Jammer is an experimental method of jamming NUHF beacon signals with random sounds that fall within the NUHF ranges as measured from 18000 hz to 24000 hz. NUHF beacons send out specific tones that are encoded to make sense to the specific app it is targeting. Usually these specific tones are centered around a particular frequency (carrier) with other meaningful tones emitted within a range above and below that frequency (drift limit). The broadcast of these NUHF beacon signals are played very fast (drift speed) and in a frequency range that humans can\'t ordinarily hear. PilferShush active jammer attempts to block these beacon signals by flooding the same frequency range with meaningless random tones. You should assume this method is unreliable, for reasons beyond this README, even if you know what specific settings are likely to match a particular NUHF beacon signal.</string>
